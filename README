CORAL LOADER

This project contains a program to load data from a spreadsheet into a typical
Coral MySQL database. It can be used to do an inital or subsequent loads. The
main flow of the program is to first set up necessary lookup tables and then parse
the data input from the tab separated input file. The best way to start is to
do an export from Coral to determine the fields that can be used to import the data.

Certain assumptions based on local use have been marked as `TODO' in the program. Local
variables can be provided in a configuration file.
